# Solidity_project
This course was designed to introduce about the basic coding knowledge to a beginner Solidity developer along with web3 and blockchains. I learnt concepts of Solidity as well as how to write a smart contract . At last i have a submission of a given challenge, the challenge is to get all these things to work and the challenge is to make my own token.

## Starting up !!
I wrote the code in Solidity Language, and I used Metacrafters ETH Proof as my learning resource which helped me creating this project.

## About the Project 

I have created my own token named "aditya" and give a token abbreviation as "adi". For Token supply i created a token totalsupply which i give a initial value to be zero (0).If we mint a token here it is "aditya" it will add to the total supply and same as burn function it will remove from the given total supply.(If it has a enough supplies)

### Implementing

* I used the Online Remix IDE to implement the solidity code.
* After implement , I saved the code as aditoken.sol file and uploaded it to this repository on GitHub.

### Running Software 

* If you're utilizing Remix IDE, you can compile the code by operate the side bar menu.
* Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the Contract  within the side bar. After deployment, you will need to give a input of specific data that the Smart Contract needs for functions like token minting and burning as well as balance checks.

## Support

I highly recommend checking out the Metacrafters academy for such amazing content. Their Discord server is Hyperactive and the people there are really welcoming and encouraging. It is a game changer moment for me to have this massive support. There are so many things to learn and more on.
